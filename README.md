**Duration:** October to November ,2024<br/>
**Project name:** TEXT TO IMAGE GENERATION<br/>
**MENTOR:** SRAVANI GOUNI<br/>

**OVER VIEW OF THE PROJECT --->>** TEXT TO IMAGE GENERATION PROJECT USING MACHINE LEARNING..<br/>

**Objective:** Develop a machine learning model capable of generating images from textual descriptions<br/>

**Data Collection:** Utilize datasets containing images and their corresponding text descriptions, such as the Microsoft COCO dataset.<br/>

**Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values and normalize the data.<br/>

Perform feature extraction from the text descriptions and images.<br/>

**Model Selection:** Use advanced models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).<br/>

Explore variations such as DALL-E, StackGAN, or AttnGAN for enhanced performance.<br/>

**Model Architecture:**

**Generator:** Converts text embeddings into images.<br/>

**Discriminator:**  Distinguishes between real images and generated images based on text input.<br/>

**Training:** Implement a training loop for the GAN, optimizing both the generator and discriminator.<br/>

Use techniques like adversarial loss to improve the model's output quality.<br/>

**Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance using metrics such as image quality and similarity to real images.<br/>

**Results:** The model generates images that accurately reflect the given textual descriptions.Achieved high-quality outputs with improved realism and detail.<br/>

**Future Work:** Enhance the model with larger and more diverse datasets.

Incorporate additional textual data to improve the richness of the generated images.

Explore more advanced GAN architectures for further refinement.<br/>
